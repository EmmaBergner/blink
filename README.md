# Blink

 [Blink](https://emmabergner.github.io/blink/) is a geographic visualisation of events, and a demo aimed for the company Telcred. This company offers a cloud service for physical access control (basically unlocking doors) worldwide. Blink can be used for other companies as well who have events and use geographic locations. 

The idea behind this is to show users that events are happening, where in the world the events are happening and at what time the events are happening.

- __The Logo and heading__

    - Center of the page: Blink is easy to spot for users, in a clear orange color. 
    - The heading: Geographic Event Visualisation is placed  just underneath the logo for a welcoming and clean impression. 
    -  This is a demo, and I've chosen my colors based of the companies own color pattern.
