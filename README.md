 [Blink](https://emmabergner.github.io/blink/) is a geographic visualization of events, and a demo amed for a company named Telcred. The company offers a cloud service for physical access control (basically unlocking doors) worldwide. Blink can be used for other companies as well who have events and use geographic locations. 

The idea behind this is to show where in the world the different events are happening. With the right location and the right time. The screen has a worldwide map where the different events shows and then disappears with a orange colored dott.
