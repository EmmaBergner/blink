# Blink

 [Blink](https://emmabergner.github.io/blink/) is a geographic visualisation of events, and a demo aimed for a company named Telcred. The company offers a cloud service for physical access control (basically unlocking doors) worldwide. Blink can be used for other companies as well who have events and use geographic locations. 
 
 The idea behind this is to show users where in the world the different events are happening, at the right location and at the right time. 
 
 -- Alt: The idea behind this is to show users events are happening,  where in the world the different events are happening, at what location the events are happening and at what time the events are happening. --
